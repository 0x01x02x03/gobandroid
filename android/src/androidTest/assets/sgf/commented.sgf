It was played recently in the 39th Myeongin tournament.

;B[pd]C[He'd already participated in the preliminary round of the LG Cup earlier this year (as an amateur player) and this was the second time he'd joined the professionals in a tournament.]
;W[dd]C[If Insun won this game, he'd get enough points to qualify as a professional according to the 'new points system' of the Korean Baduk Association. I wrote about that here: http://gogameguru.com/cho-insun-amateur-turned-professional-go-player/]
;B[qp]C[On the other hand, Park Jeonggeun became a pro in 2004, and he won the second place in the Chunwon (Tengen) Cup in 2005. He was beaten by Ko Geuntae 8p in the final.]
;W[dq]C[He made it to the final one year after becoming a pro, so it was very sensational. However, his results haven't been so good since then.

;B[co]C[Insun said "Luckily, I researched this variation a lot recently" at an interview after the game.]
;W[dl]
;B[gp]C[This variation could be pretty popular in Korea today, so that Insun researched it a lot. :D ]

;B[nq]C[Calm and good. 
Big move first and come in later. ]
;W[ko]LB[ip:A]C[There's a saying in Korea, 'jumping to the center is never bad'.
If W plays at A instead, that's more solid, but B can develop on the right side more easily later. ]
;B[cf]
;W[fc]
;B[jq]C[Brilliant idea! ]
;W[jr]LB[jp:A][iq:B]C[If W answers at A, B'd extend at B, and this group would not die easily.]
;B[ir]C[Good tesuji. 
When you're in your opponent's area, you should attach and touch like this! ]
;W[jp]
;B[iq]
;W[oq]C[Good sense. It's a kind of probing move before playing on the bottom. ]

;B[fp]LB[gn:A]C[This B group isn't completely alive yet, but because of A, it's practically alive.]

;W[qf]C[Right direction. ]
;B[nc]

;B[kc]C[A good, balanced move. The side is more important than the corner in this game as W has a good moyo on the right. ]
;W[hl]
;B[fn]C[B doesn't need to hurry as the game's still favourable. ]
;W[of]C[Good jump. The right side is W's hope.]
;B[pi]C[What a brave move! Insun's play around here looks confident! ]
;W[qc]C[W doesn't think it's the right time to attack B69, so comes here first. ]

;W[oi]C[W may think it's time to attack now! W is behind on territory, so has to gain some benefit from attacking here.]
(;B[pj]C[Right move. ]
;W[ni]C[This shape isn't familiar, but it's proper.]

Insun shows his strength in this game. It's hard to find his overplays or underplays. He played boldly and with confidence. 

As you can see, he's already pretty strong, and there're many amateur players who are nearly as strong as Insun in Korea. 

I hope more top amateur players can beat pros and get a second chance to make their dreams come true with the new points system.
