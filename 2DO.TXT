from mail by Oren Laskin:
Hey there.  I have some time to work on the source code coming up.  I
don't know if you have a list of features, but here are some I'd like
to see or work on.

1) Save program state.  I'm viewing a game, take a call or check
email, and I have to find the last game that was open.  It's a little
annoying.
2) Tsumego mode.  I have an SGF files with 600 some problems and I
worked on igoenchi on windows mobile where I could use it for
homework.  It shouldn't be too difficult to add.
3) Game viewing mode.  The letters now being put on look great, but
it's still hard to just go through a game from gogameworld.  I'd like
to adjust the font and be able to fit the comments under the board.
4) KGS-like stone placement.  I still want to be able to see the stone
I'm placing.  It seems easy to just float it above the stone.

5) IGS support.  Igoenchi has code that may be able to be used.  This
would be nice.
